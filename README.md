Hello!

This is the work place where I create my music pack with the system attached!
Once the system is ready for download and installition there will be a release version on the releases, this will include the installation method. 

What is this pack?
This pack is a msuic collection of different themes, when you see this think of Space or fantasy. These themes will have different moods, these moods can be queit, wandering, combat,boss fight, characters death. Any thing that is a scenrio in the game, can be a mood. 

The system that is attached to it, is currently only for GODOT. This system will let you, by the help of a GUI, add the music to your game. You will configure it via the GUI, load an Area into the game world which will have the settings you set, than once tha player enters
it will play the parameters set by you on the players audio player.
